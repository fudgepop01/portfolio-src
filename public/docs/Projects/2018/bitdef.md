# Bitdef

This was a very ambitious project that aimed to create a toolkit that, from an input text file, generates parsers for binary file formats. The initial goal was to generate these for typescript. This was formed from the recognition in [node-brawllib](./node-brawllib.md) that there's a whole world of low level data parsing that I have yet to understand.

I effectively went through and attempted to learn and reverse engineer enough CSharp code to understand how different file formats are structured within Super Smash Bros Brawl itself.


## Learnings

There were a few different priorities:

1. I wanted to make this happen which involves making a parser
2. as such, I had to learn what a parser was
3. I learned what a parser/lexer was, and had to learn the languages in which to write them
4. I attempted to a syntax in [nearley](https://nearley.js.org)
5. I succeeded, but now I have to learn how to even interface with binary structures in typescript
6. I now had ArrayBuffers, but what the heck are they??
7. ArrayBuffers are a contiguous series of binary data that can be interpreted in various ways through one or more interfaces such as
  - Int8Array
  - Uint8Array
  - Uint8ClampedArray
  - Int16Array
  - Uint16Array
  - Int32Array
  - Uint32Array
  - Float32Array
  - Float64Array
  - BigInt64Array
  - BigUint64Array
8. These are extermely fast relative to other means of interacting, for the browser knows it is a chunk of contiguous data and has no need to consider each element within it an "object" that can _technically_ be modified by javascript at any time
9. But...

...but at that point, I had learned about another new projecect named [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io).


## Benefits

This _was_ going to be a system that allowed me to generate parsers to help create a new cross-platform version of BrawlCrate (a Brawl modding tool) in the form of a visual studio code extension. There would have been parsers everywhere, all generated by the definitions gathered by this project.

## Skills Learned/Applied

- writing a parser/lexer using the nearley syntax
- _actual_ usage of typescript (and why it's amazing)
- low-level interafes for interacting with binary data in the javascript engine
- various different low level types
- _some degree_ of knowing how binary data is laid out in memory
