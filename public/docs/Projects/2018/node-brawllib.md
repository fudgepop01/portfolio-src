# Node Brawllib

This is around the time I wanted to get started modding Super Smash Bros. Brawl for the Nintendo Wii - but I was working on a macbook at the time. The main way of modding the game is through a CSharp application that only exists for windows, so this presents a problem:

I cannot use the application built for windows on my macbook.

To remedy this, I figured I could just... rewrite the entire library used by said application in nodejs. _Surely_, nothing can possibly go wrong.

Well,

things went wrong. I realized soon that I was in _way_ over my head with all kinds of binary parsing, pointers, structs, and more. As somone used to working mainly with javascript, I had very little concept of such low-level ideas. 

## Learnings

I learned about how little I really knew...

## Benefits

...and this gave me new mental rabbit holes to explore and learn about.

(I also learned about this cool new thing called typescript!)

## Skills Learned/Applied

- how to be humbled by discovering how little I did know, and looking at it through the lense of future opportunity and determination rather than drowning in woe and giving up.
- started to read CSharp code
- very limited knowledge of typescript
