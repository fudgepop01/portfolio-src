# GCC Display

This is a gamecube controller display that was never really released. It aimed to make use of Electron to create a window that would display the inputs of a player on screen, allowing them to record it alongside gameplay footage for video clips. 

## Learnings

I learned that `.gitignore` files exist for a reason - in this case to avoid uploading the _entire_ `node_modules` folder and all subfolders that are used to the single github repository rather than downloading them using `npm install`. I also learned that SVG elements have different style attributes than regular HTML elements - but it's also _very_ powerful tool for dynamic visualization.

I also learned just how crazy my mental stamina can be when it comes to hyperfocusing on something. For better or worse, I stayed up for about 3 days learning about new ideas and concepts left and right - everywhere I turned was a new idea to learn!

## Benefits

This was never released, but I still learned a lot about how SVG elements were made and was even able to use some vector art skills to create an SVG element for a gamecube controller and acted as a great stepping stone for future work with SVG elements.

## Skills Learned/Applied

- CSS
- Electron App Development
- SVG Elements
- using JS to interact with said SVG Elements
- Adobe Illustrator

_it appears that this is just a basic template repository that does not actually have any of the finalized code._

Here is the one existing photo of it with any functionality, however:
