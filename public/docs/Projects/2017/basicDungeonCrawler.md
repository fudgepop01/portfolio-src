# Basic Dungeon Crawler

This is exactly what the title says. It is a _very_ basic dungeon crawler made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This was one of my first times using HTML and CSS to make something happen as opposed to just relying on pure NodeJS and preexisting events.

## Learnings

I learned how to use the browser to render elements myself in a programmatic fasion with javascript, then style them appropriately according to data within that javascript file.

## Benefits

This was never shared outside of just my own now long-gone laptop, so it did not really benefit anyone aside from furthering my own learnings

## Skills Learned/Applied

- HTML
- Canvas API

## Repo

_it is quite literally just a README because I appear to have forgotten to push the changes lol_
