# Floofy Bot

Floofy Bot is a bot for [Discord](https://discord.com) back when it used a `.gg` domain using the [DiscordJS library](https://discord.js.org) (way back when it was on [9.02](https://old.discordjs.dev/#/docs/discord.js/9.0.2/general/welcome)). It was initially started by a friend that was struggling to learn coding. I figured that I knew some stuff, so I tried to help out, and what followed took me on a life-changing journey I don't regret in the slightest!~

When I was an active developer, it had a basic system using javascript events and callbacks and was quite a mess to maintain. However, others were very impressed by the features it offered. At some point I even managed to use what I learned to create a way to display "frame data" from a video game I enjoy very much (the first of its kind in an accessible manner!)

## Learnings

My friend is/was about as stubborn as I am... so, out of necessity, I had to learn to explain things I know _REEEEALLY_ well. This involves making all sorts of connections in my mind when looking through documentation and picking out what I presume to be important and making mental "bookmarks" where there is something more to explore.

## Benefits

Floofy Bot provided a number of tools that were new to many on the Discord platform. It was able to assign roles, use `eval` to allow for custom commands (note: I know now not to do this, and it has since absolutely been sanitized by its current maintainer ahahah)

## Skills Learned/Applied

- javascript
- event handling
- Basic javascript string handling
- Arrays
- 6-dimensional Arrays because we were too afraid to learn JSON because it somehow seemed scary at the time
- JSON
- why one should use a real database instead of storing everything in an enormous JSON file
- why IDEs like VSCode (and at the time, Atom) are an absolute godsend
- the importance of communication between developers
- how to self-learn through documentation and tutorial videos
- how to teach another interested individual by using what they know and guiding them rather than saying "here's information, [got it memorized](https://youtu.be/8MJFYBBpzyc)?"
- basic nodejs
- nodejs module require syntax
