# Picarto Security Bot

An automatic moderation system for those that stream art on [picarto.tv](https://picarto.tv). Back in 2019, there was an issue with bots that spammed DOXXED information of victims in their own streams. I created this as a way to allow streamers to automate the immediate deletion of these messages the moment they're sent.
