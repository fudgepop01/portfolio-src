# Modules of Aether

from the README:

```
"Modules of Aether" is the silly name I gave to this tool I developed. It's an answer to an issue I was having when trying to maintain codebases for Rivals of Aether Characters.

Previously, there was no easy way to import and export chunks of code without going through and manually copy/pasting it over and over again for each file. This can get tedious (and messy) very quickly.

However, there's an answer! Because RoA mods are based on YellowAfterLife's amazing NTT language (it's like GML, but objectively better), I'm able to create functions with the #define derective and call upon them from within the same file.

This program takes advantage of that feature! It takes the functions from a module's file and automatically puts them at the bottom of the GML scripts where they belong, potentially saving hours of mind-numbing work.

The greatest part is it will passively update the code, meaning it stays out of the way without you needing to give it so much as a single thought. If you update the import statements, upon running the program you'll see that the ### IMPORTED ### section will automatically be updated to match.
