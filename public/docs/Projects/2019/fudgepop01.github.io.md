# fudgepop01.github.io

This is my github pages website that uses github's hosting solution to deliver static pages to any visitors. I originally used it to host my hex editor, [fudgedit](./Projects/2019/fudgedit.md), and provide a demo of what it can do.

## Learnings

I learned the difference between a static site and one that requires a server to run. I knew there were frontend and backend sides of web development, but a static site can effectively exist with just the frontend and devops required to build it.

## Benefits

This site will provide a foundation for me to post and upload demonstrations of the kinds of things I am able to create. It has since evolved into this portfolio site where everything is organized in a better manner.

## Skills Learned/Applied

- static site generation
- how github pages work
