This is not actually something I made. I don't think there was a single line of code written aside from a bit of glue to plug in the rewritten [cassowary-ts](./cassowary-ts.md) library.


## Learnings

However, through studying this I did learn more about how SVG files work. This is knowledge that proved to be invaluable to me later on, allowing for custom user interface elements and effects that one can only dream of with pure HTML and CSS. 

## Benefits

None aside from learnings

## Skills Learned/Applied

- SVG files and how they work
- what constraint solvers are and their role in the generation of dynamic layouts and images
