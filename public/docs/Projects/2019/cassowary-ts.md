# Cassowary TS

Awhile back I was interested in constraint solvers for the purposes of layout. I ended up finding [CassowaryJS](https://github.com/slightlyoff/cassowary.js) but was disappointed with the lack of typescript types - so I went and rewrote it in typescript from the ground-up.

In hindsight it may not be a huge deal, but at the time I was really excited to have successfully ported an old javascript codebase to a more modern, maintainable framework!~


## Learnings

It ended up doing little for folks. It wasn't something I shared around a lot, and I naively went to the original creator with the idea that such a thing just being sprung out of the blue rather than a pull request of any kind would be appreciated.

I have since learned _not_ to do that ahahah~

## Benefits

It would have provided type definitions and the ability for folks to read and maintain the code easier.

## Skills Learned/Applied

- porting Javascript to Typescript
  - included various things about how javascript fundamentally works:
    - how classes are just syntactic sugar for prototype chains
    - what prototype chains even are in the first place
    - how to convert between the two
