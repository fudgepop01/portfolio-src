# streamer dashboard

An unfinished tool created when interested in streaming. I noticed that creating dynamic layouts for streamers was difficult and cumbersome, so I wanted to create something that integrates with an intuitive tool (such as [figma](https://www.figma.com)) and make it easy.

A plugin was created that allows figma to export elements with metadata that are then read and rendered properly with this tool, broadcasted on a localhost server and controlled by commands sent through a websocket.
