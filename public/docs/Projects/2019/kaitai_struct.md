# Kaitai Struct

Kaitai Struct is a declarative parser generation library. It allows users to describe a file format through a YAML specification and generate a parser for said file format in one of a variety of target languages.

In this way it can technically be thought of as a transpiler - as if a markup langauge like HTML generated the source code needed to render a webpage rather than just being used as a description of layout to be interpreted by a rendering engine.

## Learnings

Through this I learned how to a simple configuration file can be turned into so much more. I had previously attempted to create my own binary parsing solution that would have used ideas such as creating my own c-like structure definition language that was written in Typescript.

## Benefits

I had contributed to and studied the scala codebase, engaging in discussion about how to go about topics such as serialization and finding out what more might be done. It is through these contributions that I got my first internship at Microsoft.

## Skills Learned/Applied

- basic Scala
- teamwork / communication
- networking
- **far** better knowledge of git
- methods of communciation between developers of a repository apart from using git bug reports
