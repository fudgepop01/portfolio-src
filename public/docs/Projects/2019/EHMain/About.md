# EHMain

EHMain was a web application that looked to provide services to members of the organization I was a part of at college, Engineering House. It looked to help with things such as

- taking event attendance
- organizing events
- making announcements
- keeping track of those who are/are not members

It looked to use both frontend and backend development skills - and though I learned a lot and quite a few hours were spent on it, nothing was officially released. Still, it was a good experience to have and it taught me a lot about how backend/server code may actually work.

## Learnings

A large part of this project was figuring out how to send and recieve signals from a web server. I chose to do this with Koa, the spiritual successor to ExpressJS. There was also the use of VueJS (specifically Vue2) in the frontend that I tried and fell in love with right away. While it isn't my main frontend preprocessor/framework of choice, I wouldn't mind learning it again.

## Benefits

Though it was never deployed, I learned some new things as always - but others who were exploring and learning skills in their own majors also picked up some ideas of where things within the organization could be improved.
