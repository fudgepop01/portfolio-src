# Kaitai IDE VSCode

This is my first large-scale vscode extension. It had the goal of making a way to integrate Kaitai Struct with my hex visualizer and provide an intuitive IDE for analyzing file formats, and I succeeded!
 
It integrates the hex visualizer through a webview with a custom interface.

## Learnings

There were some challenges in the creation of this. 

1. the webview

2. figuring out how to extract information from a generated parser and present it to the user

For one thing, I had to use a gargantuan amount of recursion to walk through the tree of debug properties generated by a binary parser in debug mode.
