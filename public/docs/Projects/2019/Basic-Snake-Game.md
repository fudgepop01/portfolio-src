# Basic Snake Game

This is exactly what the title says - it is a very basic game of snake written in javascript.

As a college student, this was assigned within a web development class as a group project. My classmates focused on the site itself while I took on the task of coding up this interactivity and noting steps along the way like a tutorial.

It used my knowledge of javascript and the canvas API to create a game that can be easily played and customized. It's a good thing that I was not tasked with showing this customizability, however, because looking at it now it appears that there was an off-by-one error that makes any new walls inserted into the maze be detected one tile down and one to the left.

Given my expeirence prior to this class, I was able to complete this in about 4-5 hours, with documenting and wiring it up to the website taking about 2 more hours.

## Learnings

- How to document code in a presentable way
- How to guide other classmates through using visual studio code to code in a collaborative environment

## Benefits

This netted the group members and I high marks, with the presentation going quite well! I even saw a few others just trying to beat their score for the hell of it, which was fun to see!

## Skills Learned/Applied

- javascript class syntactic sugar
- javascript modules using `import/export` thanks to codesandbox setting up what I would soon come to know as a web framework known as `parcel`
