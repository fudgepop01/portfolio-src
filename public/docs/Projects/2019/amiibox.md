# Amiibox

a project created for the customization of amiibo figurines using the findings of amiibo_research. For the first time ever, users were able to customize the parameters behind the AI behavior of their amiibo instead of exclusively being able to customize their stats.

Builds On:
- [fudgedit](./fudgedit.md)
- [amiibo_research](./amiibo_research.md)
