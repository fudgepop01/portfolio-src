# Rivals of Aether Toolbox 2 (RoABox2)

An interactive toolbox building on knowledge accumulated since RoABox 1, taking full advantage of my sveltejs knowledge. It had an interactive visualizer and timeline, reading and executing GML code in the proper order to ultimately emulate the result that would appear in-game, complete with the ability to programmatically send inputs. 

It was never released because I ultimately figured out that I would have to emulate the entire game state that users _don't_ have access to, making it ultimately not worth the effort.
