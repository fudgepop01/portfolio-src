# Rivals of Aether GML

Building off of knowledge from the failed RoABox2, I moved over to a visual studio code extension with proper support for files without me having to reinvent the wheel. It does feature various visualizers, but it is far more basic than before. Even so, it provides autocompletion support recently updated with proper documentation and all the latest functions and user-discovered variables.
