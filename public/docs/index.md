# Welcome to the Homepage!~

I'm Dominick Reba, known online as `fudgepop01`.

I love trying to figure out and follow through with ideas whenever I get the
feeling of "there has _got_ to be a better way..." - and in going with my gut on
these feelings, I've picked up a wide variety of programming languages and
meta-skills that have greatly improved the lives of myself and others!~

Currently I'm working for [Aether Studios](https://aetherstudios.com)
([@StudiosOfAether](https://twitter.com/StudiosofAether)), creating advanced AI
for the platform fighter, Rivals 2.

## About This Website

This is a project I created back in 2020 (specifically, 11/13/2020) that was
made as a wiki alternative for folks that were part of a video game modding
group. The old wiki was cumbersome to edit with slow servers and the wiki
syntax which made table editing very unintuitive.

This uses github as a hosting platform, allowing users to submit change requests
through said website. Overall, it is very well-recieved and still blows the
minds of others who didn't know it exists. here's a link: https://brawlre.github.io/public/

The whole system will be described in further detail on the page for this project.

> _For those of you who miss the old homepage (for some reason??) don't worry! All that stuff will be
accessible through the sidebar on the left. Speaking of..._ 

## Navigation

On desktop devices you will find the navigation menu to the left. This is the main way you'll
get around on this site, or by using special links.

On the right you'll find the different headings of an article. You can click one to instantly scroll
to that section.

On mobile (or if your screen is under 1000 pixels wide), there will be two menus icons on the top.
The one on the left will open the main navigation menu, and the one on the right will open the heading
navigation menu that lets you immediately jump to that respective part of the article.
